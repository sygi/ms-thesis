\chapter{Hyperparameters}\label{hyperparams}
The list of hyperparameters and their descriptions. Most of the descriptions come from \cite{nature-dqn}.
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{} l c Y @{}}
\toprule
hyperparameter & value & description \\
\midrule
minibatch size & $32$ & Number of training cases over which each stochastic gradient descent (SGD) update is computed. \\\addlinespace
replay memory size & $100\,000$ & SGD updates are randomply sampled from this number of most recent frames. \\\addlinespace
phi length & $4$ & The number of most recent frames experienced by the agent that are given as input to the Q network in case of the networks that accept screen as input. \\\addlinespace
update rule & \texttt{rmsprop} &  Name of the algorithm optimizing the neural network's objective function   \\ \addlinespace
learning rate &  $0.0002$  & The learning rate for rmsprop\\ \addlinespace
discount & $0.95$ & Discount factor $\gamma$ used in the Q-learning update. Measures how much less do we value our expectation of the value of the state in comparison to observed reward.\\\addlinespace
epsilon start & $1.0$ & The probability ($\varepsilon$) of choosing a random action at the beginning of the training. \\\addlinespace
epsilon decay & $1000000$ & Number of frames over which the $\varepsilon$ is faded out to its final value. \\\addlinespace
epsilon min & $0.1$ & The final value of $\varepsilon$, the probability of choosing a random action. \\\addlinespace
replay start size & $100$ & The number of frames the learner does just the random actions to populate the replay memory.\\
