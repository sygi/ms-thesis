\chapter{Foundations}
\todo{Tell that our work is based on previous work in ai, some invented years ago, some just now}

\section{Reinforcement learning}
\todo{Define general reinforcement learning}
\todo{Define MDP}
\todo{Give some examples of reinforcement learning problems and describe why they are MDPs}
\todo{Tell what is the goal of reinforcement learning-algorithm inventor}
\section{Q-learning}
\todo{Define Q-value}
\todo{Define Q-learning algorihtm}

\section{Deep Learning}
\todo{Tell that this chapter defines deep learning, which is a set of machine learning methods invented recently, owning state-of-the-arts methods in many domains}
\todo{Shortly cite some results}
\subsection{Neural networks}
\todo{Define neural network}
\todo{Cite some early works}

\subsection{Deep Learning revolution}
\todo{Tell that these methods were not considered state-of-the-art models until recently}
\todo{Tell that there came much faster GPUs, which allowed to have deeper networks evaluated quickly}
\todo{Tell that there were invented algorithms that better move in the multidimensional space of parameters, faster converging to a better local minimum}
\todo{Tell that it was not expected and cite Krizhevsky paper}

\todo{Tell about libraries: Torch, Theano, Tensorflow, the latter two allow for automatic differentiation}
\todo{Tell about libraries built on top of these: Keras, blocks, TFLearn}
